- [OperationalPoint](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.ERA/blob/master/OperationalPoint/README.md). An operational point (OP) means any location for train service operations, where train services may begin and end or change route, and where passenger or freight services may be provided; operational point also means any location at boundaries between Member States or infrastructure managers.
In https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2019/773/oj 2.1.2 Principal locations (stations, yards, junctions, freight terminals).

Indication of maximum number of raised pantographs per train allowed and minimum spacing centre line to centre line of adjacent pantograph heads, expressed in metres, at the given speed.
Each track can have several raised pantographs per train allowed (structured) values, and each one has values for number of pantographs, minimum distance between pantographs, in metres, and speed considered in km/h.

- [SectionOfLine](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.ERA/blob/master/SectionOfLine/README.md). A section of line means the part of line between adjacent operational points and may consist of several tracks.
