It is a subclass of the ERA Feature that has a spatial representation. It covers tracks, platforms, signals, tunnels, operational points, and sections of line.\nA feature that belongs to the infrastructure can be abstracted (hasAbstraction) as a topological object. It also is related to the infrastructure manager through the property infrastructureMgr."
